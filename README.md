Goals:
* Output into the DOM.
* Use a template literal.
* Use a for...of loop.  
* Instantiate an object or object(s) of a class.  
* Add an element to an array.  
* Loop through (iterate through) an array.
* If you are adding functions or using methods, use ES6 standard.

JS Review - 31 March 2020
Arrays
Const, Let and Var are the three ways to assign a variable
console.log seasons

Various types of array manipulate

.push adds an element to the end of the array
.pop removes the last element in an array a(and return the value)
.splice 3 arguments
index
number of elements to replace
the new element

SLICE for strings (vs splice for arrays)

a ‘+’ sign is EITHER concatenation or addition (concat if a string on one side)

.concat 2 arrays

have now run through:
class constructior
instances of our class
a method that returns a value

Line 142 - document.body
we can target the body of the html page directly instead of having to create a div or p tag element 


line 157 - let product of myProducts
this is an ES6 systax to shorten a loop such as: “let i =0, i < array.length, i++
product is the current index of myProducts and will cycle through all elements in the array

WHILE loop
While( Termination Condition )

FOR loop
for (Declaration; Termination Condition; Increment)


querySelector targets attributes in the html element

using ‘submit’ is more versatile than using a button for a number of reasons

*** DOM & EVENTS ***

Line 240 - Need ‘event listener’ in js DOM to listen
(dl) wrapper to a 
(dt) dataListTitle
(dd) datalist 

Octothorpe
. (dot) targets class
Octothorpe/hashtag targets id
attribute selector is square brackets []

ctrl - alt - shift  and  then arrows to select will select multiple lines of text and paste 

Arrow Function
Line 270 - A
a dot means we are accessing either a property or a method

Whenever element.innerHTML is used, all event listeners 
Whenever you update an element in html, all the children are refreshed


element.appendChild would be an alternative, but need to re-create the whole form structure each time you append


Line 291 - preventDefault()

**NOTE** 
Refresh ourselves on the Arrow Function

-------------

STRINGS
UPPERCASE/lowercase
slice out characters and apply methods
review array vs string slice (eg 2 vs 3 methods)


.replace (needle, newtext ) 
Note: ‘needle’ syntax 
Replaces a substring within a string.
